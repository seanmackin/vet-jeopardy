title: vet jeopardy, author: sean mackin

this is a local, in-browser "Jeopardy"-style game made as simply as possible, while still retaining responsiveness and the original game aesthetic.

in order to use this, simply download this repo in a folder of your choice, then copy the path of the html file and paste it into your browser. the category titles and questions should be hardcoded at the bottom of the script.js file.

this is NOT an online or server-based application, but could be made into one fairly easily. this does not support variable players or score-tallying - this should be left up to the instructor (assuming classroom usage, as designed).
